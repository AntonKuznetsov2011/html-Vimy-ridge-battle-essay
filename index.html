    <h1>Vimy ridge battle essay</h1>
    <h2>By Anton Kuznetsov</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Battle of Vimy ridge was fought from 9 to 12 April of 1917 by mostly Canadian army against German army and was one of the biggest Canadian in 1 world war. About 3598 Canadians were killed in the assault and about 20000 German casualities this battle also was a start of the end of 1 war as Germany didn't gain land but started to lose more and more of it. After this battle Canadians started to gain more respect from other countries.</p></li>
        <li><p>When the troops were practicing before battle they were doing it very differently they tried to reconstruct Vimy ridge and even practiced what speed they should walk not to be hit by their own artilerry and to effectively capture Vimy ridge at the same time also they used invented by Canadians technology called "indirect fire" which means that soldier is shooting from the machine gun not aiming at his target and not giving his opponent an opportunity to do anything without a chance of getting shot, also they used new technologies of sound measurement to find enemies artillery and to destroy it later, both Canadians and Germans had underground subways.</p></li>
        <li><p>The battle had began at 4 am on April 9 after a lot of bombarding, 15000 Canadian troops started an attack on Vimy ridge on the right side and at the center of the frontline 1st Canadian Division, the 2nd Division, and the 3rd Division, arrived at the German front line with most defenders still waiting in their dug outs, it was a bit easier for the 3rd division because the allied bombarding caused more distraction for the Germans then at the way of 1st and 2nd divisions so enemies machine guns caused a big trouble for them, but they still made their way to the assigned point. But deals were not so good with 4th division who had to capture hill-145 which was the highest point on the ridge and as bombarding hadn't deal enough damage to this position it was protected very goodly with a lot of trenches and machine guns, and their attack was destroyed badly and hill-145 wasn't captured even by nightfall, and was taken only by the next days afternoon by the 4th division reserve the 4 days long battle ended on April 12 by the Canadian victory.</p></li>
